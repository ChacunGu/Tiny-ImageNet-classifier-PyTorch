# Tiny-ImageNet-classifier-PyTorch

## Main objective

Complete implementation of a classifier for a custom Tiny ImageNet dataset using PyTorch.

## Context

This assignment is developped in Python 3 for the Advanced Topics in Machine Learning course of the Master in Computer Science in the university of Bern, Switzerland.

The train, validation and test data were given. The objective was to implement and design a convolutional neural network and its training with PyTorch's optimizer and loss function. An ablation study was done to better understand the impact of some hyperparameters / architecture choices.

This assignment was an individual work.

Spring 2020.
